# Lip-Reading-in-Native-Language

Automated Lip reading is a use-case for speech recognition through visual interpretation without relying on audio cues. It is an emerging field that involves understanding speech by observing a speakerâ€™s lip movements using machine learning
techniques. This helps address accessibility issues for those with hearing impairments and in noisy settings. Identifying commonly used words and phrases in the
Hindi language, we created a script inspired by the GRID Corpus Dataset. Due to
the lack of publicly accessible Hindi language lip-reading datasets, we created our
custom dataset consisting of videos of 20 subjects speaking a pre-selected script.
On this data, we performed pre-processing and extracted features for model training. Random forest classifier achieved an optimistic training accuracy of 34.125%
for predicting a sentence consisting of 10 words.
